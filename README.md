# Simultanio
Swift application for synchronizing time across OSX and iOS.

## Getting started
This application was part of my M.Sc. Thesis done at The IT University of Copenhagen spring 2015.
The idea of the application is that you can synchronize time across OSX and iOS devices using only WiFi.
For this to work there must be a minimum of three devices running, there is no maximum.
The devices must all be on the same subnet.

Read more about the project in the [thesis report](https://github.com/mofus/Simultanio/blob/master/mellson_thesis.pdf).

### Project
To build the project you need to put some mp3 files in the ```audio``` directory and fix the error in ```Node.swift```
You may also need to import or remove the HockeyApp integration.
